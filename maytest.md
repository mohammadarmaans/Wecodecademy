JAVA SCRIPT TEST (10 MAY) 

Que1.)
 What is Javascript Engine? Name the most famous Javascript engines. 

Ans1. )
Javascript engines are used for interpreting the Javascript codes , it helps us to interpret the javascript and make it machine under stable   as browser can read and understand the javascript but  the machines Or computers can’t understand the Javascripts so we need a program to which helps ur to convert the javascript program to a computer under stable language.
  
There are many javascript engines: 
1. Spider Monkey 
It is used by Mozilla 
2.V8 
It is used by Google

V8 is the most pf the famous Javascript Engines. 



Que2.) 
Explain the use of this keyword? What are the different uses of this keyword.  

Ans2.) 
If we want to access the properties or values of the same object in an fuction than we use the “this keyword” 
So we don’t need to write name the object again and again. 
When we are making a function and this function is called as a object  the “this” keyword will called as an object and if this function is standalone the “this” keyword will refers to a global object.  

Que3.) 
Difference between Json and XML? 

Ans3.) 
XML: XML is Extensible Markup Language 
It is markup language 
Helps to store and transfer data
XML uses tags like “<> <\>”
And Xml also helps in storing the data of a software 
Remains same for all languages
It not supports array
It is used representation of datas

Json: Javascript Object notation  
If isn  data format
json don’t use tags it uses names and values it use brackets “{ }”
It is also remains same for all languages 
Array support
It represents objects  

Que5.)Write difference between compiler and interpreter with example? 
 
Ans5.) 
Compiler : A compiler scans the entire program at once and then translate it into machine codes 
In compiler all of the error are shown at once and the program stops to execute so first we have to remove and correct all the errors from program then it will start working otherwise it does not executed 
Examples: C,C++,Javas
Interpreter: 
A interpreter scans a program line by line by then translate them to a machine code 
Interpreter shows only one error of lines 
It is slower as compare to compiler as it shows 1 error of line of program 
 Example:python and Javascript. 


Que4.)Explain Heap, Cache, Stack, Ram Memory? 
Ans4.) 

Chache Memory: Cache memory is the memory which used to store the files or data which we use the most or we use daily so it store the them and when we need that files it provides us. And it is volatile memory


Heap Memory: Heap memory is non-primitive type of memory 
In heap memory if we are doing or program or function then with that function we got a direct reference  (original form) of that function.
As if we want to change the value or objects then we’ll change in the main file 

Stack Memory: Stack memory is primitive type of memory
In an Stack memory while we are doing a function the we get a copy of that program like the main variable of object will saved in stack and then  we make one more function the value of an object then this will also get saved in the stack and as another function executed the first one object from stack will removed.

Stack memory in computing system is memory location where data is stored and we can add or remove data from this in the form of last in and first out Manner and 
This is allocated in the form of like blocks like example bunch of books, one book on another.(use key site h Jesse ki ek book ka bundle or Jesse ki ek book ke super ek book) 
 
Ram Memory: Ram Memory is Random access Memory, it is direct access memory. 
This is Volatile Memory 
In Ram all the task performed by CPU and these are saved in RAM memory of computer 
Ram is the very important thing in a computer system because as we rum or use a computer system then computer need some storage to perform to work properly and this storage if provided by RAM. 

Que7.)Difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?  

Ans7.) 
Primitive Data types: Primitive data types stored in form of values of main object and original values of object are cant changed.
 There are six types of data types 
1. Number: It represents Numerical Values 
2. Boolean: It has logical values that are - true & false
3. String: Used to represent text data or data in single or double commas-(‘ ’, “”) 
4. Symbol: Used to create to unique objects
5. Null: Null means those data types which doesn’t have values 
6. Undefined: when we declare a variable but the value is not assigned 

Non-primitive Data types: 
In  Non-primitive Data types values are stored with references 
There are to types of Non-primitive Data types : 
1.  Array : In Array we can add one or more elements in an object
2. Object :
